# Rushie Client For TravelToDDNet

**Rclient** is my personal, slightly chaotic, fork of **[TaterClient](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet)**

I've stole some features: the core functionality from [**TClient**](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet), Laser and scoreboard from [**Pulse Client**](https://github.com/PulseClient-ddnet/DDNetPulse), Discord rpc and ChatBubbles from [**Entity Client**](https://github.com/qxdFox/Entity-Client-DDNet), and some of mine functions.

This client has a lot of code stolen from other great open-source clients. Feel free to use and reuse anything you find here!

I **can't guarantee everything is bug-free**, but I'm doing my best to fix things as they pop up. If you spot a problem or a crash, please tell me on Discord so I can look into it!
